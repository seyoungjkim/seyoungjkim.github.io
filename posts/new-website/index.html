			<p>The first version of this website was published in October 2017, the semester I started studying computer science. For some reason, a large number of college students who study computer science have personal websites (basically resumes, but shinier), so I got the idea I should make one too. Unfortunately, I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<p>Eventually I had created a basic website with a couple pages and a resume by slowly hand-coding some HTML and CSS files. It was an extremely annoying process that turned me off of working on the website aside from a few small content updates. I always meant to come back and improve the site once my skills improved, but never felt compelled to.</p>
<p>Three years later, I&rsquo;ve realized that most people with pretty, minimalist websites and blogs are using static site generators. I decided to give Hugo a shot. So far, I&rsquo;m pleased with how easy it&rsquo;s been to use! I love using Markdown, and I can definitely see myself tinkering with different themes in the future.</p>
