I'm Seyoung Kim, a comedy writer and performer based in Brooklyn, NY.

## Comedy
I write and perform sketch for two teams. One is [Party Trick](https://magnettheater.com/ensembles/party-trick), a house team at the Magnet Theater. The team has been selected for festivals including Austin Sketch Fest, DC Sketchfest, Philly Sketchfest, and PackFest. The other is [Queer Window](https://www.instagram.com/queerwindow), an indie team that performs at several venues in NYC.

I co-direct sketch for Magnet's [REMIX Diversity Sketch Lab](https://magnettheater.com/2024/08/01/remix-the-diversity-sketch-lab-2024).

Most recently, I co-wrote, directed, and produced ["A Sketch Show... Or Else"](https://www.brooklyncc.com/show-schedule/sketchshoworelse-8-1) with my comedy partner Jacob Stone.

And finally, you can see me perform improv comedy with my indie teams [Paid 2 Be Here](https://www.instagram.com/paid2behere) and [The Slaysians](https://www.instagram.com/theslaysiansnyc).
