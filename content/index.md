I'm Seyoung Kim, a comedy writer and performer based in Brooklyn, NY.

## Comedy
I write sketch for [Party Trick](https://magnettheater.com/ensembles/party-trick), a house team at the Magnet Theater. The team has been selected for festivals including Austin Sketch Fest, DC Sketchfest, Philly Sketchfest, and PackFest.

I've also directed sketch for Magnet's [REMIX Diversity Sketch Lab](https://magnettheater.com/2023/08/26/remix-the-diversity-sketch-lab-2023/).

Most recently, I co-wrote, directed, and produced ["A Sketch Show... Or Else"](https://www.brooklyncc.com/show-schedule/sketchshoworelse-8-1) with my comedy partner Jacob Stone.

And finally, you can see me perform improv comedy with my indie team [Paid 2 Be Here](https://www.instagram.com/paid2behere).
