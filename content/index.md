Hello! I'm Seyoung.

I'm a software engineer at [Plaid](https://plaid.com). Before then, I was an intern at Flexport and at Amazon Web Services. I graduated from Penn with a bachelor's degree in computer science.

Previously, I played cello in a string quartet, performed stand-up comedy, and moderated a [college meme group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781). Currently, I write for the sketch team [Party Trick](https://magnettheater.com/ensembles/party-trick) at the Magnet Theater.
