Hello! I'm Seyoung. I just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in computer science, and I'm currently a software engineer at [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). In the past, I've been an intern at Flexport and Amazon Web Servies.

At Penn, I played cello in a string quartet, was a moderator for the Penn [meme group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781/), performed stand-up comedy, and wrote for Penn's humor and satire blog, [Under the Button](https://www.underthebutton.com/staff/seyoung-kim).
