I got tired of browsing the Penn Course Register archives whenever I wanted to see what times of day a course has previously been offered - pretty useful information when planning a future course schedule without class conflicts. After scraping the PDFs for course information, Penn Course Timetable was born.

Beta version is [here](https://penn-course-timetable.herokuapp.com), and code is [here](https://github.com/seyoungjkim/penn-course-timetable).
