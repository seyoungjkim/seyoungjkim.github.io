The first version of this website was published in October 2017, the semester I started studying computer science. For some reason, a large number of college students who study computer science have personal websites (basically resumes, but shinier), so I got the idea I should make one too. Unfortunately, I had no idea what I was doing.

Eventually I had created a basic website with a couple pages and a resume by slowly hand-coding some HTML and CSS files. It was an extremely annoying process that turned me off of working on the website aside from a few small content updates. I always meant to come back and improve the site once my skills improved, but never felt compelled to.

Three years later, I've realized that most people with pretty, minimalist websites and blogs are using static site generators. I decided to give Hugo a shot. So far, I'm pleased with how easy it's been to use! I love using Markdown, and I can definitely see myself tinkering with different themes in the future.
