      Hi! I'm Seyoung, an incoming software engineer at <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>.
      I just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in computer science.
      Last summer, I worked on the Customs Engineering team at
      <a href="https://www.flexport.com/">Flexport</a>. Previously, I was at Amazon working on 
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/">AWS Greengrass</a> and also dabbled in
      physics research at Penn.

      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seyoungjkim/">LinkedIn page</a>.

      At Penn, I played cello in a string quartet, was a moderator for the Penn meme group,
      performed stand-up comedy, and wrote for Penn's humor and satire blog,
      <a href="https://www.underthebutton.com/staff/seyoung-kim">Under the Button</a>.
