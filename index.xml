      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Seyoung. I just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in computer science, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently a software engineer at Plaid. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve been an intern at Flexport and Amazon Web Servies.
At Penn, I played cello in a string quartet, was a moderator for the Penn meme group, performed stand-up comedy, and wrote for Penn&amp;rsquo;s humor and satire blog, Under the Button.

      <description>The first version of this website was published in October 2017, the semester I started studying computer science. For some reason, a large number of college students who study computer science have personal websites (basically resumes, but shinier), so I got the idea I should make one too. Unfortunately, I had no idea what I was doing.
Eventually I had created a basic website with a couple pages and a resume by slowly hand-coding some HTML and CSS files.</description>
