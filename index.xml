      <description>The first version of this website was published in October 2017, the semester I started studying computer science. For some reason, a large number of college students who study computer science have personal websites (basically resumes, but shinier), so I got the idea I should make one too. Unfortunately, I had no idea what I was doing.
Eventually I had created a basic website with a couple pages and a resume by slowly hand-coding some HTML and CSS files.</description>
